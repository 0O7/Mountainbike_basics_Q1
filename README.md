# Mountain Bike Basics

## Synopsis

New to the biking world? Should you buy a bike with both front and back suspension? Buy a bike with more gears? less? what is a derailer?!
[Mountain Bike Basics](show-both-staged-and-unstaged-changes) will help you understand the different functioning parts of a mountain bike from gears to the front hydraulic suspension. 

## Motivation

1. I have just learnt about maintaining a mountain bike and upon researching there weren't any intuitive websites that offered a simple pictorial description of bike parts. Most required you to read hundreds of lines of text. 
2. One month into learning about web development I wanted to push my boundaries to see what's possible, what I can develope in one week. I wanted to make an interactive 3D model of a mountain bike where you can click on parts and a part description will pop up.
