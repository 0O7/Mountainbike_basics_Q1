### Motivation

This idea all started when I was researching about mountain bike maintenance for my bike. After some research I couldn't find any intuitive websites that offered a simple pictorial description of bike parts. Most required you to read hundreds of lines of text.
So, after one month into learning about web development at Galvanize I turn my idea into reality. I wanted to make an interactive 3D model of a mountain bike where you can click on parts and a part description will pop up.
